// Test data
$baseUrl = "http://localhost:8000/api/v1";
$adminToken = "YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN_HERE";
$studentToken = "YOUR_STUDENT_TOKEN_HERE";

echo "🔧 CONFIGURATION:\n";
echo "Base URL: $baseUrl\n";
echo "Admin Token: $adminToken\n";
echo "Student Token: $studentToken\n\n";

echo "📝 TEST STEPS:\n\n";

echo "1. Create a program first:\n";
echo "POST $baseUrl/admin/programs\n";
echo "Headers: Authorization: Bearer $adminToken\n";
echo "Body: {\n";
echo "  \"title\": \"Test Workshop\",\n";
echo "  \"date\": \"2025-11-15\",\n";
echo "  \"location\": \"Test Location\",\n";
echo "  \"enable_qr_attendance\": true\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "2. Create a student:\n";
echo "POST $baseUrl/admin/students\n";
echo "Headers: Authorization: Bearer $adminToken\n";
echo "Body: {\n";
echo "  \"email\": \"teststudent@example.com\",\n";
echo "  \"password\": \"password123\"\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "3. Invite student to program:\n";
echo "POST $baseUrl/admin/programs/1/invite\n";
echo "Headers: Authorization: Bearer $adminToken\n";
echo "Body: {\n";
echo "  \"student_id\": 1\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "4. Student accepts invitation:\n";
echo "PATCH $baseUrl/student/applications/1/accept\n";
echo "Headers: Authorization: Bearer $studentToken\n\n";

echo "5. Student marks attendance:\n";
echo "PATCH $baseUrl/student/applications/1/attendance\n";
echo "Headers: Authorization: Bearer $studentToken\n";
echo "Body: {\n";
echo "  \"email\": \"teststudent@example.com\",\n";
echo "  \"password\": \"password123\"\n";
echo "}\n\n";

echo "🔍 VERIFICATION:\n";
echo "Check the application status at each step:\n";
echo "- After invite: status = 'invite'\n";
echo "- After accept: status = 'accepted'\n";
echo "- After attendance: status = 'attend'\n\n";

echo "📊 VIEW RESULTS:\n";
echo "GET $baseUrl/admin/programs/1/applications\n";
echo "Headers: Authorization: Bearer $adminToken\n\n";

echo "GET $baseUrl/student/applications\n";
echo "Headers: Authorization: Bearer $studentToken\n\n";

echo "🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOMES:\n";
echo "✅ Student gets invited successfully\n";
echo "✅ Student can accept invitation\n";
echo "✅ Student can mark attendance via QR\n";
echo "✅ Admin can view all applications\n";
echo "✅ Status transitions work correctly\n\n";

echo "🚨 COMMON ISSUES:\n";
echo "1. Make sure database is running\n";
echo "2. Check authentication tokens are valid\n";
echo "3. Verify student and program IDs exist\n";
echo "4. Ensure proper headers are set\n";
echo "5. Check file permissions for uploads\n\n";

echo "💡 TIPS:\n";
echo "- Use Postman or similar tool for easier testing\n";
echo "- Check Laravel logs for detailed error messages\n";
echo "- Verify database records after each step\n";
echo "- Test both success and error scenarios\n\n";

echo "Ready to test! 🚀\n";
