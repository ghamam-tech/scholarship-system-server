# Certificate Token Management - Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive test scenarios for the Opportunity and Program application endpoints with a focus on certificate token management.

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Opportunity Application Tests (Scenarios 1-10)
1. ‚úÖ Get students available for invitation
2. ‚úÖ Invite students to opportunity
3. ‚úÖ Get all opportunity applications
4. ‚úÖ Update status to 'accepted' (should NOT generate token)
5. ‚úÖ Update status to 'attend' (SHOULD generate token if completed)
6. ‚úÖ Change status back to 'accepted' (SHOULD remove token)
7. ‚úÖ Re-set status to 'attend' (SHOULD regenerate token)
8. ‚úÖ Get opportunity attendance records
9. ‚úÖ Generate missing certificate tokens endpoint
10. ‚úÖ Delete application using formatted ID

### Program Application Tests (Scenarios 11-17)
11. ‚úÖ Get students available for program invitation
12. ‚úÖ Invite students to program
13. ‚úÖ Get all program applications
14. ‚úÖ Update program status to 'attend' (generate token)
15. ‚úÖ Generate missing certificate tokens for program
16. ‚úÖ Change program status to 'accepted' (remove token)
17. ‚úÖ Delete program application using formatted ID

### Edge Cases & Error Handling (Scenarios 18-21)
18. ‚úÖ Invite to non-existent opportunity (404 expected)
19. ‚úÖ Update non-existent application (422 expected)
20. ‚úÖ Delete non-existent application (404 expected)
21. ‚úÖ Handle very long formatted IDs (correct parsing)

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Laravel server must be running: `php artisan serve`
2. Database must be seeded with test data
3. You need a valid admin bearer token

### Get Admin Token
Login as admin to get the token:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "password"
  }'
```

The response will contain a `token` field. Use this as your admin token.

### Run All Tests
```bash
php test_certificate_token_management.php YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN` with the token from the login response (e.g., `1|abc123def456...`).

### Example Output

## Certificate Token Behavior

### When Tokens are Generated
Certificate tokens are **automatically generated** when:
- ‚úÖ Application status is `'attend'`
- ‚úÖ Opportunity/Program status is `'completed'`
- ‚úÖ `generate_certificates` is enabled (always true for opportunities)

### When Tokens are Removed
Certificate tokens are **automatically removed** when:
- ‚ùå Application status changes from `'attend'` to any other status
- ‚ùå Opportunity/Program status changes from `'completed'` to any other status

### Manual Token Generation
If you have existing applications with `'attend'` status but no tokens (because they were marked attend before the opportunity/program was completed), use:

**For Opportunities:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/admin/opportunities/{opportunityId}/generate-certificates
```

**For Programs:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/admin/programs/{programId}/generate-certificates
```

## API Endpoints Reference

### Opportunity Application Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/admin/opportunities/students/for-invitation` | Get students available for invitation |
| POST | `/admin/opportunities/{opportunityId}/invite` | Invite students to opportunity |
| GET | `/admin/opportunities/{opportunityId}/applications` | Get all applications |
| PATCH | `/admin/opportunities/{opportunityId}/applications/status` | Update application statuses |
| GET | `/admin/opportunities/{opportunityId}/attendance` | Get attendance records |
| DELETE | `/admin/opportunities/applications/{applicationId}` | Delete application |
| POST | `/admin/opportunities/{opportunityId}/generate-certificates` | Generate missing tokens |
| GET | `/admin/opportunities/applications/{applicationId}/excuse` | Get excuse details |
| PATCH | `/admin/opportunities/applications/{applicationId}/approve-excuse` | Approve excuse |
| PATCH | `/admin/opportunities/applications/{applicationId}/reject-excuse` | Reject excuse |

### Program Application Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/admin/programs/students/for-invitation` | Get students available for invitation |
| POST | `/admin/programs/{programId}/invite` | Invite students to program |
| GET | `/admin/programs/{programId}/applications` | Get all applications |
| PATCH | `/admin/programs/{programId}/applications/status` | Update application statuses |
| GET | `/admin/programs/{programId}/attendance` | Get attendance records |
| DELETE | `/admin/programs/applications/{applicationId}` | Delete application |
| POST | `/admin/programs/{programId}/generate-certificates` | Generate missing tokens |
| GET | `/admin/programs/applications/{applicationId}/excuse` | Get excuse details |
| PATCH | `/admin/programs/applications/{applicationId}/approve-excuse` | Approve excuse |
| PATCH | `/admin/programs/applications/{applicationId}/reject-excuse` | Reject excuse |

## ID Format Support

Both opportunity and program endpoints support:
- **Numeric IDs**: `12`, `43`
- **Formatted IDs**: `opp_0000012`, `prog_0000043`
- **Very Long IDs**: `opp_120000000000000030450`

The system automatically parses and normalizes all ID formats.

## Troubleshooting

### Test Fails with 401 Unauthorized
- Your admin token has expired or is invalid
- Get a new token by logging in again

### Test Fails with 404 Not Found
- Opportunity/Program/Application doesn't exist
- Update the test script with valid IDs from your database

### Token Not Generated for 'attend' Status
- Check that the opportunity/program status is `'completed'`
- Check that `generate_certificates` is enabled
- Use the `/generate-certificates` endpoint to manually generate missing tokens

### Token Not Removed When Status Changes
- The model boot method runs on every `update()`
- If you're using raw SQL queries, tokens won't be managed automatically
- Always use Eloquent's `update()` or `save()` methods

## Database Verification

To manually check certificate tokens in the database:

```sql
-- Check opportunity applications
SELECT 
    application_opportunity_id,
    student_id,
    opportunity_id,
    application_status,
    certificate_token,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM application_opportunities
WHERE opportunity_id = 7;

-- Check program applications
SELECT 
    application_program_id,
    student_id,
    program_id,
    application_status,
    certificate_token,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM program_applications
WHERE program_id = 4;
```

## Notes

- All tests require admin authentication
- Tests create and delete temporary data
- Some tests depend on existing seeded data (opportunity 7, program 4, student 4)
- Adjust IDs in the test script if your database uses different values
